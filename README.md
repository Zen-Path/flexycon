    <h1>Flexycon</h1>
    <p>ðŸ§© Where configuration meets automation ðŸ’¡</p>
</div>

Flexycon (from _flexible_ + _configuration_) is my personal configuration ecosystem â€” a unified system
for managing configs, scripts, snippets, and shared utilities.
Instead of isolated dotfiles or one-off scripts, every component is designed to work together and build
off of one another.

By combining templating and a dotfile manager, I ensure that only the configuration I actually need is
deployed â€” customized automatically for each environment.

Examples:

```sh
# Per-platform config
{%@@- if os == "darwin" +@@%}
export TERMINAL='kitty'
{%@@- elif os == "linux" +@@%}
export TERMINAL='alacritty'
{%@@- endif +@@%}

# Per-profile config
{%@@- if "home" in profile +@@%}
alias je='journal_entry'
{%@@- endif +@@%}

# Environmental variables substitutions
editor = '{{@@ env["EDITOR"] @@}}'

# Easy file importing â€” break large configs into smaller pieces
{%@@ include 'config/zsh/shortcuts.sh' @@%}
```

# Setup

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following installed:

- `git`
- `python >= 3.13`

## Installation

To install and initialize the project:

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/Zen-Path/flexycon"
cd flexycon
./bootstrap.sh
```

Later on, when you've made some changes to your config and want to apply them, run `./flexycon.py install`.

When testing changes to the venv, or just need a clean slate, run `./flexycon.py clean` and it will do just that.

NOTE: the recommended location for installing flexycon is `~/.local/src/flexycon`, but if you've installed it
somewhere else, update the `FLEXYCON_HOME` environmental variable.
